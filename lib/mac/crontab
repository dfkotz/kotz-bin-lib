# DFK crontab
#=============================================
#  Each crontab file entry consists of a line with six fields, separated by
#  spaces and tabs.  The information in the fields specifies when the command
#  runs and the name of the command.  The fields specify the following:
#
#    o  The first field specifies the minute (0 to 59).
#
#    o  The second field specifies the hour (0 to 23).
#
#    o  The third field specifies the day of the month (1 to 31).
#
#    o  The fourth field specifies the month of the year (1 to 12).
#
#    o  The fifth field specifies the day of the week (0 to 6 for Sunday to
#       Saturday).
#
#    o  The sixth field specifies the shell command to be executed.
#
#  You can specify the following values in the fields that indicate the time:
#
#    o  An integer (within the appropriate range of values)
#
#    o  Two integers separated by a dash to indicate an inclusive range
#
#    o  A list of integers separated by commas
#
#    o  An asterisk to select all possible values
