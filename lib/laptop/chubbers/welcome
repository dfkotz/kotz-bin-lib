Welcome to ChubberNet!

ChubberNet was created as a "place for alum chubbers to meet". It is a
list of chubber alums who are interested in keeping in touch. Typical
traffic includes people's trip reports, queries about places to
travel, and occasionally news of interest from Hanover.  C&T senior
ugrads are added to the list every fall, as a "bridge" to the
alumni. The new C&T Chairs and DOC Presidents are also added to the
list every spring.

To send a message to the list, send email to
    chubbers-alum@listserv.Dartmouth.edu

Once a month, I send a list of all chubbers on the list.

To change your address, write to me at dfkotz@mac.com

Yours in the Out-of-Doors,
