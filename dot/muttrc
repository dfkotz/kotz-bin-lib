### README ###
# For mutt to be able to send mail from my mac, I followed the instructions
#   https://gist.github.com/loziju/66d3f024e102704ff5222e54a4bfd50e
# See my comment on that page at
#   https://gist.github.com/loziju/66d3f024e102704ff5222e54a4bfd50e#gistcomment-3434439
# 
# I put the following in /etc/postfix/sasl_passwd 
#   smtp.mail.me.com:587 dfkotz@mac.com:PASSWORD
# where I obtained PASSWORD by getting app-specific password from
#   https://appleid.apple.com/account/manage
# following some advice from
#   https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT202304
#
# I had to adapt the loziju instruction step 1, replacing Gmail with:
#   relayhost=smtp.mail.me.com:587
# The resulting change to main.cf is as follows.
#
# # Added by DFK, adapting these instructions:
